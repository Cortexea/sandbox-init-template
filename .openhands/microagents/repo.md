# Decentralized Application (dApp) Starter Kit: Frontend + Blockchain

## Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive starter kit for building decentralized applications (dApps). It integrates a plain JavaScript frontend with a Hardhat-based blockchain development environment. Use this as a foundation to develop and deploy your dApps.
You may assume Node.js, npm, and Hardhat are installed and configured.

## Structure
Your working directory is `/workspace/sandbox-init-template`. The key structure of this project is as follows:

## Technical Stack

**Frontend:**
- plain old javascript project 

**Blockchain:**
- **Development Environment:** Hardhat
- **Smart Contract Language:** Solidity
- **Testing:** Mocha/Chai (via Hardhat)
- **Deployment/Interaction:** Ethers.js
- **Package Manager:** npm

This implementation provides a robust foundation for a modern decentralized application. Build upon this structure to implement specific user requirements.
