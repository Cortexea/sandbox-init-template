# Frontend Project Repository

## Overview
This is a skeletal directory structure of a decentralized application with React (frontend). Use this as a starting point to complete the user's requests.
You may assume npm and react are installed. If you encounter not-found error, then attempt install.

## Structure
Your working directory is `/workspace`. It has a directory called sandbox-init-template, under which there are multiple subdirectories and files. You can safely assume the following structure exists:
```
sandbox-init-template
   ├── frontend                     # React app
   │   ├── package-lock.json
   │   ├── package.json             # has required dependencies like react
   │   ├── public                   # empty
   │   └── src                      # You will need to create App.js and other files here
   │       ├── components           # empty
```

## Technical Stack
- React

This implementation provides the minimum viable structure for a frontend app. Build upon this foundation to implement specific user requirements. Your task is done when you've tested that the implementation works.
